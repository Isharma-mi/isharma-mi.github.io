The following are projects done for personal fun using skills learned from work.

## Linux Setup
*Description*: Setup Linux on an external SSD for learning commands and customization.

- Prepared a bootable USB drive with the Ubuntu ISO image flashed onto it via balenaEtcher
- Installed the Ubuntu distro on the SSD with two partitions: ext4 for Linux and exFAT for data sharing with Windows.
- Customized the terminal via shell scripting to display system details (CPU, GPU, RAM) and set transparency on startup.
- Integrated AppImages (ex: Audacity) into the desktop environment with proper icons and launch entries for improved usability.
