Hello there!

My name is Ishaan Sharma and I am a Cloud Engineer based in Atlanta, GA. This site serves to give some information about me and act as a portfolio.

I earned my Bachelor's at Georgia State University and started working as a Medical Assistant at St. Joseph's Pediatrics. During this time, I saw how important technology was for us to provide the best care to patients. Databases and programs helped us to quickly retrieve records and ensure all information on the patient was readily available. Afterwards, I started working at PINS Consulting LLC which focuses on healthcare from the IT aspect. Since then, I have been sharpening my cloud computing skills while earning certifications in AWS for foundational knowledge. For instance, I have implemented various Infrastructure as Code(IaC) solutions via CloudFormation and recently Terraform while also using Java, Python and SQL for other tasks.

Along with automating cloud infrastructure deployments/setup, security is another interest of mine. I have not had much experience in cloud security, but it is something I aspire to specialize in.
